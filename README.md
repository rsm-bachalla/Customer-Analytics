## Introduction: 
In the Customer Analytics course, I learned how to use data to make better business decisions. The course taught me to understand customer behavior by working on real-life business problems. I got to use different tools and methods like logistic regression, neural networks, and more to figure out things like which customers might leave a service (churn prediction) or how to group customers together in useful ways (segmentation).

**1. Intuit QuickBooks**: Predictive Modeling for Marketing Efficiency

**Objective**: To predict small business responses to a QuickBooks upgrade campaign, enhancing marketing strategy and profitability.

**Techniques/Models Used**: Data manipulation, logistic regression, and neural network models were employed, with a focus on predictive modeling to identify likely upgraders.

**Key Findings**: The analysis emphasized the importance of feature engineering, outlier removal, and model tuning. A neural network model was ultimately selected for its higher expected profit and accuracy

**2. Creative Gaming: Uplift Modeling for Campaign Effectiveness**:

**Objective**: To optimize the Zalon campaign targeting in the game "Space Pirates" by employing uplift modeling to identify customers most likely to be influenced by the marketing campaign.

**Techniques/Models Used**: Logistic regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models were used for uplift modeling, focusing on maximizing incremental profits by accurately targeting persuadable user segments.

**Key Findings**: The analysis showed that uplift modeling is more efficient in targeting, reducing wasteful expenditure by focusing on persuadables and enhancing overall campaign effectiveness compared to traditional propensity models​

**3. S-Mobile: Customer Churn Prediction**:

**Objective**: To develop a predictive model identifying customers at risk of churning by analyzing historical data on customer behavior and characteristics. The goal was to transition from reactive to proactive churn management strategies.

**Techniques/Models Used**: Logistic regression and neural network models were compared, with the neural network model being chosen for its better performance in predicting churn.

**Key Findings**: Variables like occupation, equipment days (eqpdays), and overage were significant predictors of churn. Targeted actions were recommended for different customer segments to mitigate churn risk​

**4. Pentathlon: Next Product to Buy Modeling**:

**Objective**: To optimize email marketing strategies by identifying the right balance in promotional email frequency and maximizing incremental profits through targeted customer segments.

**Techniques/Models Used**: Logistic regression, XGBoost, Random Forest, and neural network models were trained to refine email marketing tactics.

**Key Findings**: The study identified optimal email frequency and customized communications based on customer segment profitability, using advanced analytics to enhance marketing effectiveness​

**5. PFG Bank (aka Capital One): Credit Card Design**:

**Objective**: To maximize customer value and bank profitability by selecting optimal credit card product variations and executing direct mail campaigns.

**Techniques/Models Used**: Logistic regression and neural network models to analyze customer response data, along with experimental design for profit optimization.

**Key Findings**: The campaigns targeted potential customers based on creditworthiness, focusing on optimizing Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) and Customer Acquisition Value (CAV)​

## Conclusion:
I did a lot of hands-on projects where I had to clean data, choose the right model, make predictions, and explain what the results mean for a business. This helped me see how what we learn in class can actually help businesses understand their customers better and make smarter choices.

Through this course, I've gained skills and confidence in using data to answer important business questions. Here, I'm sharing some of the projects and assignments I worked on, which show how I've applied what I learned to real-world scenarios.
